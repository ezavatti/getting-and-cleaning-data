# getting-and-cleaning-data
PROJECT 1- GETTING AND CLEANING DATA- COURSER - 2015

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate studentâ€™s ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
The files in the repository are the following:
1)	a tidy data set as sorted by

2)	a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis

3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work
   that the student performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

Although once a tidy data is created and is ready for any further analysis, two sorted tidy data are provided:
a.	By subject and then by Activity
b.	By Activity and then by subject
